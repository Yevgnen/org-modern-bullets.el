#+title: org-modern-bullets

* Introduction

This package tries to make the list bullets of  ~Org-mode~ prettier when using mixed pitch fonts for Unicode characters.

The idea is simply and silly: use fixed pitch font to display the leading white spaces and the bullets to have them well aligned. Benefits of using fixed font:

- well alignment
- increase margins before texts

** Installation

*** ~straight.el~

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package org-modern-bullets
  :straight (:host github :repo "Yevgnen/org-modern-bullets.el")
  :hook (org-mode . org-modern-bullets-mode))
#+end_src

Enabling ~org-indent-mode~ is optional.

** Configuration

To use this package, please use a /fixed pitch font/ for the related faces: ~org-modern-bullets-unordered-face~ and ~org-modern-bullets-ordered-face~.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(custom-set-faces
 '(org-modern-bullets-unordered-face ((t (:family "Courier" :height .6))))
 '(org-modern-bullets-ordered-face ((t (:inherit org-modern-unordered-bullets)))))
#+end_src

The package is designed to work with ~org-indent-mode~, and should also work with ~visual-line-mode~. The most important config is to make sure both ~org-modern-bullets-unordered-face~ and ~org-modern-bullets-ordered-face~ faces have the same width as the ~org-indent~ face. e.g.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(custom-set-faces
 '(org-indent ((t (:family "Courier" :height .6))))
 '(org-modern-bullets-unordered-face ((t (:inherit org-indent))))
 '(org-modern-bullets-ordered-face ((t (:inherit org-modern-unordered-bullets)))))
#+end_src

Please note that

- if you set a very large font height for the mentioned faces, the alignment could still be broken.
- the package is not tested under complex Org environment with rich elements.
- try to find a font for bullets that work well with your mixed pitch fonts!

* Screenshot

[[file:images/screenshot.png]]

The face setting in the screenshot is ~'((t (:family "SF Mono" :height .75)))~.

* Limitations

This package does not support ~*~ bullets for unordered list currently.
